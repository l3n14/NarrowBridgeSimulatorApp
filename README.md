# NarrowBridgeSimulatorApp
 The program illustrates the simulation method concurrent threads, simulating vehicles that must drive from opposite directions cross a narrow bridge. In this program, we have a limited bandwidth bridge that is a shared resource for two groups of vehicles moving on opposite sides directions. Vehicle traffic must be coordinated so as not to violate the restrictions capacity, and so that all vehicles can cross the i bridge continue onward journey. When simulating a bus crossing a narrow bridge, different ones can be taken into account bandwidth limitations. With no restrictions, no bus will be stopped before entering the bridge. A simple rule allows simultaneous movement in both directions but limits the number of buses on the bridge at the same time. A more restrictive rule limits not only the number of buses on the bridge but also assumes that all vehicles on the bridge they are moving in the same direction. The most restrictive rule is across the bridge Only one bus passes at a time.
